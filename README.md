# 3773Project2
So I've constructed the skeletons needed for the project based on the class diagram made for the first half of the project. 
Each class should have comments for each method as well as an overall comment at the top of the class. Please be aware
that each class comment will need to be edited once the class is completed. I will leave that up to each individual working on
the class. We may discover the need for more methods as we fill out each skeleton: this is fine. Just please insert your own
comments in the same format as the ones currently in place. Also, be aware that each constructor is not completed. You may have
to add parameters as you fill it out.
